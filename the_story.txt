Once upon a time, 

<<<<<<< HEAD
It all started one rainy evening as Mohammeddiab was banging away at their
Darwin computer's keyboard.  He was doing an excellent job at it too!Talkin to
his fellow gamers in a server of discord.  However, after awhile he got
bored.Very creeped out that this story knows their name. Playing some
Overwatch, wrecking some noobs. Some people didn't think the universe be like
it is, but it do. He decided to start his own frozen yogurt shop and call it
Microsoft. No copyright law in the universe can stop me! - he said. "Why not?"
the universe replied. But, little did he know...

There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing.
The lake was a long way from here. There was a man named Sam. He loved universe
so much. But the universe was indifferent.

A new day started A day filled with sunshine and happiness. Dragons were
killing everyone  The result of which would shock the world. Winter is comming,
Nothing burns like the cold. This is your last chance. After this, there is no
turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed
and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in
Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes. Remember that all I am
offering is the truth. He tried to take the blue pill, but there was a mix-up.
You would never guess what happened next. A bird crashed through his basement
window!But that was okay with me.

You would never guess what happened next. A bird crashed through his basement
window! It was Errol, who had just recovered from hitting the Weasley's window.
In bird culture, this is considered a dick move. He began to eat it with great
ferocity. Chowing down on some pancakes and waffles.  No one would expect this.
It was one of his favorite meals.I was finally there to sit on my throne as the
Prince of Bel-Air In other news, that's also why bears love honey. Since he
didnt know what he was doing he failed the class. How amazing! Joe made the
sugar cookies; Susan decorated them.There is no hope What am I going to do
next? I decided to become the most wild breakdancer on the streets. I will beat
all the breakdancers. And the smell was just fantastic.I'll be wearing my baggy
tracksuit and high-top sneakers.Beetoven with almost certain probability was of
African Descent! Beetoven with almost certain probability was of African
Descent!Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall
Humpty Dumpty had a great fall
I'll be wearing my baggy tracksuit and high-top sneakers.Beetoven with almost
certain probability was of African Descent! Beetoven with almost certain
probability was of African Descent!

But enough with Beetoven, let's talk about Sofware EngineeringActually, scratch
that, let's not talk about it

There was a kid in Software Engineering 1 who had no idea what he was doing. No one knows from where he came, but many say his past still haunts him. The lake was a long way from here. There was a man named Sam. He loved universe so much. But the universe was indifferent. Also, I still play Runescape and I'm 21. Though they say the price of flax would never climb, I am certain they are wrong.
